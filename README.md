# Evodoop

This project is a combination of **EvoSuite** and **Randoop** to generate test suites with higher code coverage.

To reproduce the results, run bash scripts *$project_root_path/evodoop.sh* followed with a parameter indicating the number of versions of test suites you want to generate for Randoop and EvoSuite respectively.

The final test suites will be output at *$project_root_path/test_suites/evodoop* directory.
